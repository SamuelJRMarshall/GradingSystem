# GradingSystem
A command line programme for teachers to record students grades in their class.

This was completed following along with the C# pathway on Pluralsight, course 1.
I have added additional features on top of the initial software from the course:

# New Features:
- Teacher classes, who have a group of students
  - Teachers have a login system
  - What subject they teach
  - How many students they have
  - Their students average grade
  - The best student in the class
  
- Students
  - All test results in a comma delimited file
